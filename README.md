### https://www.wireguard.com/

*WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.*

*At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share any personal information. That's our privacy policy in a nutshell. For example, we do not store IP addresses, and we do not create unique cookies. As such, we do not even have the ability to create search histories or search sessions for any individual — privacy by design.*


*To be clear, this means __we cannot ever tell what individual people are doing since everyone is anonymous__, and that is a limit of our statistical methods since we are private by design. We can, however, within this anonymous limitation, reliably determine what changes are generally working, using these anonymous methods.*


*We have developed these systems from scratch, instead of using third-party services, because of our privacy promise to never collect or share any personal information. We're proud to be able to improve our site for you in a completely anonymous way!*

### https://www.safenotes.org/

*Output of the program is as safe as possible and is by far one of the most secure encryption programs in the world. Only criteria during the development was maximum security.*

*Every single encryption or hashing algorithm was judged only based on it's quality with speed being irrelevant. Maximum emphasis was also placed on implementation and use of individual cryptographic functions and software as whole.*

*Only way to decode original content is by using correct password. Successful attack on two 4096 bit keys and 256 bit encrypted salt with using 6 respected symmetrical ciphers in safe cascade belongs to the realm of fantasy.*

*Program doesn't include any backdoors and design itself doesn't allow hiding them.*

### https://tox.chat/ OR (https://keybase.io/)

*Tox began a few years ago, in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks regarding NSA spying activity. The idea was to create an instant messaging application that ran without requiring the use of central servers. The system would be distributed, peer-to-peer, and end-to-end encrypted, with no way to disable any of the encryption features; at the same time, the application would be easily usable by the layperson with no practical knowledge of cryptography or distributed systems.*

### https://www.bitvise.com/

*Bitvise SSH Server and Client have an excellent security track record. Since our software was first released in 2001, we have found occasional issues. All of these were fixed promptly as they came to our attention. The security of our software is our first priority, followed by reliability, followed by performance and features.*

*Vulnerabilities specific to other SSH implementations tend to not apply to ours. Our software is developed independently and does not share code with OpenSSH and other implementations. Our SSH protocol implementation is one of the more stringent ones, on several occasions exposing flaws in other implementations.*

# Notes

My little project is not to help you setup, configure, or troubleshoot your Pi-Hole® or network setup. It is assumed that you know the basics of setting up and using pihole and its related technologies, including how to add blocklists to Pi-Hole®.

### https://volumio.org/

*Volumio project was born in late 2013, out of frustration by the lack of valid solutions to emancipate digital music playback from ordinary PCs, usually big, loud machines with poorly performing softwares for music streaming.*

*We wanted the flexibility to control our music through web interfaces, the ease of managing it all in a single place and the possibility to move beyond PCs and towards better performing machines. But, above all we longed for a software crafted and dedicated to maximize audio quality at bit-perfection level.*

*We decided it was time to build our own audiophile music player.*
