# Due to a busy life, I've currently put this little project on semi-hold. Meaning that updates will be much less frequent than intended for a while. Please fell free to use lists and add, mod, and update them on your own.

# PiHoleblocklists

- I really like Cybersecurity, because you're always one step behind.

- Free for all to use, but I do not take any responsibility for wrong usage: the action, amount, or mode of using

- USE AT OWN RISK!

- Threats are according to otx.alienvault.com © Copyright 2020 AlienVault, Inc.

- Every link reported should be considered harmefull and could result in an unwanted malware download.

- I use these lists on my Raspberry Pi 4 with Pi-Hole® - to play around with! 

- The lists have only been tested/used with/on the Pi-Hole® software.

- I do not work for, have anything to do with, nor am I affiliated with **otx.alienvault.com** OR **Pi-Hole®** in any way. I only use their service & software.

- I do think that a DNS sinkhole, like Pi-Hole® adds a great layer of extra security, that is usefull if updated and maintained.

/Cheers!


# What is otx.alienvault.com?

### World's First Open Threat Intelligence Community

Threat sharing in the security industry remains mainly ad-hoc and informal, filled with blind spots, frustration, and pitfalls. Our vision is for companies and government agencies to gather and share relevant, timely, and accurate information about new or ongoing cyberattacks and threats as quickly as possible to avoid major breaches (or minimize the damage from an attack). The Alien Labs® Open Threat Exchange® (OTX™) delivers the first truly open threat intelligence community that makes this vision a reality.

### How OTX Works

OTX provides open access to a global community of threat researchers and security professionals. It now has more than 100,000 participants in 140 countries, who contribute over 19 million threat indicators daily. It delivers community-generated threat data, enables collaborative research, and automates the process of updating your security infrastructure with threat data from any source. OTX enables anyone in the security community to actively discuss, research, validate, and share the latest threat data, trends, and techniques, strengthening your defenses while helping others do the same.

# What is Pi-Hole?

The Pi-hole® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

Configure your router’s DHCP options to force clients to use Pi-hole as their DNS server, or manually configure each device​ to use the Pi-hole as their DNS server.

By pairing your Pi-hole with a VPN, you can have ad blocking on your cellular devices, helping with limited bandwidth data plans.

You can run Pi-hole in a container, or deploy it directly to a supported operating system via our automated installer.

Pi-hole is free, but powered by your donations.

# Software Favorites for use & work with Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi-Hole!


### https://dietpi.com/
*What is DietPi?*
*DietPi is a highly optimised & minimal Debian-based Linux distribution. DietPi is extremely lightweight at its core, and also extremely easy to install and use.*

*Setting up a single board computer (SBC) or even a computer, for both regular or server use, takes time and skill. DietPi provides an easy way to install and run favourite software you choose.*

### https://pi-hole.net/
*You can run Pi-hole in a container, or deploy it directly to a supported operating system via our automated installer.*
*Our intelligent, automated installer asks you a few questions and then sets everything up for you.  Once complete, move onto step 3.*
*Configure your router’s DHCP options to force clients to use Pi-hole as their DNS server, or manually configure each device​ to use the Pi-hole as their DNS server.*
*By pairing your Pi-hole with a VPN, you can have ad blocking on your cellular devices, helping with limited bandwidth data plans.*

*The Pi-hole developers are spread across the globe and work on the project in their spare time.  We are a 100% remote team.*

### https://github.com/azlux/log2ram

*Like ramlog for systemd (on debian 8 jessie for example).*

*Usefull for RaspberryPi for not writing on the SD card all the time. You need it because your SD card doesn't want to suffer anymore!*

*The script log2ram can work on every linux system. So you can use it with your own daemon manager if you don't have systemd.*

### - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall
*The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an adminstrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream for other distributions and graphical frontends.*

*Why should you donate to Notepad++?*
*More donation = more money = More money allows me buy more coffee = More coffee makes me write more code = More code means more features = More features make you more productive = More productive so you earn more money = More money you earn more donation to me = More Muhahaha…*

I find it very hard to argue against - it is simply the truth ^^.

# Notes
My little project is not to help you setup, configure, or troubleshoot your Pi-Hole® or network setup. It is assumed that you know the basics of setting up and using pihole and its related technologies, including how to add blocklists to Pi-Hole®. 

Besides, the reason why hackers and such are having golden days is because most people don't care or simply don't know about cybersecurity. Don't believe this statement?
