# PiHoleblocklists

  I really like Cybersecurity, because you're always one step behind.

  Free for all to use, but I do not take any responsibility for wrong usage: the action, amount, or mode of using

  USE AT OWN RISK!

  Threats are according to otx.alienvault.com © Copyright 2020 AlienVault, Inc.

  Every link reported should be considered harmefull and could result in an unwanted malware download.

  I use these lists on my Raspberry Pi 4 with Pi-Hole® - to play around with!

  The lists have only been tested/used with/on the Pi-Hole® software.

  I do not work for, have anything to do with, nor am I affiliated with otx.alienvault.com OR Pi-Hole® in any way. I only use their service & software.

Cheers!
