*What is DietPi?*
*DietPi is a highly optimised & minimal Debian-based Linux distribution. DietPi is extremely lightweight at its core, and also extremely easy to install and use.*

*Setting up a single board computer (SBC) or even a computer, for both regular or server use, takes time and skill. DietPi provides an easy way to install and run favourite software you choose.*

### https://github.com/azlux/log2ram

*Like ramlog for systemd (on debian 8 jessie for example).*

*Usefull for RaspberryPi for not writing on the SD card all the time. You need it because your SD card doesn't want to suffer anymore!*

*The script log2ram can work on every linux system. So you can use it with your own daemon manager if you don't have systemd.*

*Why should you donate to Notepad++?*
*More donation = more money = More money allows me buy more coffee = More coffee makes me write more code = More code means more features = More features make you more productive = More productive so you earn more money = More money you earn more donation to me = More Muhahaha…*

I find it very hard to argue against - it is simply the truth ^^.

# Notes
My little project is not to help you setup, configure, or troubleshoot your Pi-Hole® or network setup. It is assumed that you know the basics of setting up and using pihole and its related technologies, including how to add blocklists to Pi-Hole®.
